# Geometry Shape Calculator

## Description

Write a C# library for distribution to external clients that is capable of calculating the area of a circle given its radius, and the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. In addition to functionality, the following will be evaluated:

- Unit tests
- Ease of adding other shapes
- Calculating the area of a shape without knowing the shape type at compile-time
- Checking whether a triangle is right-angled
